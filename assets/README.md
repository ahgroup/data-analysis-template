# Assets

This folder should contain all static content from outside sources which is
neither code nor generated by code. This includes, but is not limited to,
schematics generated from biorender, other images taken from outside sources,
`csl` files, `bib` files, pdf files of references, etc.

As needed, this can be organized further. For instance one could have separate folders for references or figures (again, not figures generated by code, only manually created figures, e.g. conceptual/schematic drawings).

The `csl` files are referenced in your Quarto docs and influence the style of the references both in the text and at the reference listing at the end.
Journals require specific formats. While writing, I recommend you use either the more explicit (Author, year) format (as e.g. implemented in `vancouver-author-date`) or tha more concise [#] format that just shows numbers (as e.g. implemented in `american-journal-of-epidemiology.csl`). You can download many more reference style files from here:

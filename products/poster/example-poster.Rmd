# Background

* For future universal influenza vaccine candidates, it will be important to quantify protective immunity against not just the vaccine components, but a broad range of genetically different influenza strains.
* HAI antibody titer is the most commonly used correlate of protection for influenza.
* To determine vaccine **strength**, HAI increase or post-HAI titers against the homologous vaccine components are measured.
* To determine vaccine **breadth**, HAI titers against heterologous strains are measured.
* Unless the panel of heterologous strains are the same, it is difficult to compare between vaccines/studies.
* Quantifying homologous **strength**, heterologous **breadth**, and **total** vaccine response will be useful.

# Approach

* We analyzed HAI data pre- and post-vaccination for vaccine and heterologous strains from the UGAFluVac cohort study. 
* We determined the distance between vaccine strains and heterologous test strains using 3 measures: 1) Years, 2) Genetic Distance, 3) Antigenic Distance.
* We fitted linear models and computed intercept, slope, and area under the titer increase curve to determine **strength**, **breadth** and **total** vaccine response.
* We illustrated how this framework can be applied to compare Standard Dose (SD) with High Dose (HD) Fluzone vaccines.


# Distance measure comparison

<!-- We first explored the impact of the different strain distance measures on estimates for strength, breadth and total vaccine response. -->

```{r figstrains, out.width='100%', fig.cap="HAI titers for the three distance measures: 1) Years; 2) Genetic distance as quantified by p-epitope; 3) Antigenic distance quantified by shortest path on an antigenic cartography map. Each distance measure was normalized to have comparable ranges between 0 and 1. (Homologous) Strength = Intercept of fitted line. (Heterologous) Breadth = Slope of fitted line. Total response = Area under the curve/line. Standard dose vaccine recipients only."}

```


```{r, tabstrains, eval = FALSE}
#| tab.topcaption:	FALSE
readRDS(here::here(mediapath,"wide-table.Rds")) |>
  flextable::set_caption("Summary statistics for HAI titer increase for all influenza A vaccine strains in the dataset. A value closer to zero for breadth indicates a more broad response, i.e., a response that doesn't decline as quickly as strains become more distant.") |>
  flextable::fontsize(size = 28, part = "all") |>
  flextable::padding(padding.left = 15) |>
  flextable::padding(padding.right = 15) |>
  flextable::padding(padding.top = 3) |>
  flextable::padding(padding.bottom = 3)
```



# Dose comparison example

<!-- We applied the above defined vaccine quantification measures to compare the impact of standard- versus high-dose Fluzone vaccines. -->

```{r figsdhd, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Strength, breadth and total amounts of HAI titer increase for standard dose (SD) and high dose (HD) vaccine recipients. Only individuals 65 years and above are included."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here(mediapath,"p2.png"))
```

```{r, tabdose, eval = FALSE}
#| tab.topcaption:	FALSE
readRDS(here::here(mediapath,"dose-table.Rds")) |>
  flextable::set_caption("Comparison of HD and SD vaccine formulations. Shown is the difference (HD - SD) of each of the three outcome measures. Positive values indicate a stronger and broader HD response, negative values indicate that SD is superior.") |>
  flextable::fontsize(size = 28, part = "all") |>
  flextable::padding(padding.left = 15) |>
  flextable::padding(padding.right = 15) |>
  flextable::padding(padding.top = 3) |>
  flextable::padding(padding.bottom = 3)
```


# Extensions

* Multi-level statistical models might help further refine the estimates.
* Models that are more flexible than linear models can be explored.
* Interaction between **strength** and **breadth** needs consideration.
* Different weighting for **total** response calculations are possible.
